## Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG
The purpose of this analysis was to apply a linear regression on the dataset contained in MechaCar_mpg.csv to evaluate the variablility between MPG (miles per gallon) and five other variables: Vehicle Length, Vehicle Weight, Spoiler Angle, Ground Clearance and Drivetrain. The output of the linear regression can be reviewed in the figure below in the first call. We can deepen our analysis by reviewing the summary of this linear regression in the second call below. To determine the significance contribution of each of the five variables on MPG, we need to review the individaul variable p-values. Our analysis shows that Vehicle Length and Ground Clearance have a significant impact on MPG (p-values of 2.60^e-12 and 5.21^e-8 respectively). The overall p-value for this model is 5.35^e-11, far below the 0.05 significance level, meaning we can reject our null hypothesis and assume that the slope of our linear model is not zero. In assessing whether this model effectively predicts MPG of MechaCar prototypes, we also noted that the R-Squared value for this model is 0.7149, which means that roughly 70% of the variability of MPG predictions are captured in this model. Based on this assessment, we can conclude that our model adequately quantifies and predicts MPG for MechaCar prototypes.
